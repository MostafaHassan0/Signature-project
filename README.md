The page will be hosted on only local network.

<b>Potential improvements:</b>
> Creat a login page that only allows the usre to login and not sign in.
> <br>The login will be connected to the company employees database. Which will allowus to imediatly knwo their info once they are logged in automatically and only leaves the room for verification.
> <br>This could limit security risks and human mistakes
